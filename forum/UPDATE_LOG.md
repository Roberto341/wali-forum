### Overview
- Wali Forum is a `PHP` Project created by **Robert Scharaswak Jr**.
- This project was never supposed to be made but after some thinking and brain storming the idea finally lit up
- **Robert** Took his pen and notebook out and started sketching the first idea:
    - A basic login and registration system
    - A basic table to put the forums and threads in a listed order
    - And a basic profile overview and update.
- The very first version didnt go to plan tho, being desinged with bootstrap it just didnt look the way **Robert and his team imagined it**. So back too the drawing board him and his team went took 3 weeks to finally come up with a new idea after multiple test runs with frameworks both with and without `PHP Support`. The `React` framework was sorta doing the job but it got overwhelming really quick, **Robert** has next to no knowlege about `React` so it made it difficult so he switched to laravel a php framework. It was going alright until he hit a roadblock and didn't know how to navigate the framework or write anything. **Next**.
So here comes Symfony another `PHP` framework, after getting set up and taking a tour around **Robert** Decided that wasn't it either it was way harder then Laravel, So back to just plain `PHP` he went.
- The second version aka wf_0.0.1.a which is this commit right here. After spending a couple weeks creating the first layout of this new system, is way different then the other systems he's made, first off it has clases in it **Robert's** old projects never had classes, it also has enums, and custom made functions, also functions built into classes.
Which has made the development alot easier, the only thing you will see in this commit is the login and registration system it's enough for a first commit so were pushing with this too start with, other things will come along tho as the project goes on.
